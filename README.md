# veredit

Script based editor for structural Verilog netlists.

## Description

Veredit can automate editing of a structural verilog netlist. It can automate
any edit that a designer normally would do with a text editor. It has a few
smarter functions like insert a buffer, buffer reentrant outputs, insert observe
modules and show the hierarchy.
