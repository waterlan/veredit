PREREQUISITES

        Requires for a clean build:

            gcc >= 4.5.0
            flex >= 2.5.35
            bison
            imake
            GNU make
            perl

        For older versions of gcc use a different Config.h:

            cp Config.h.gcc422 Config.h

BUILDING

        If you have a working imake flow on your system
        type the following command to compile:

            ./Compile

        If you don't have a working imake flow
        you can try using the included Makefiles:

            make
            make -f Manual.mk
